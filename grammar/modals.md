#Modals

Modal verbs (`can`, `could`, `may`, `might`, `must`, `will`, `would`, `shall`, `should`, `ought to`, `need`) are auxiliary verbs that _give information about ability, possibility or necessity_.

Model verbs are **followed by the infinitive without _to_** and their form doesn't change:

> He **could speak** French and Italian.

> **Could** you **speak** French before you lived there?

##Ability

These following verbs are used to talk about ability:

||Verbs|Example|
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
|Present| `can`, `can't`, `be able to`, `manage to`| I **can't** swim |
|Past| `could`, `couldn't`, `be able to`, `manage to`| They **weren't able to** find out his name |
|Perfect| `be able to`, `manage to`| **Have** you **manage to** finish the report yet? |
|Future| `be able to`, `manage to`| I **won't be able** to meet you later. |

It is **more common** to use `can/could` to talk about **general ability** in the present and past than `be able to`:

> **Can** you remember much about it? (= Are you able to remember?)

> He **could** speak French and Italian, but he couldn't remember his name.

To _talk about ability_ on one **specific occasion in the past**, use `couldn't, was(n't)/were(n't) be able to`, but not `could`:

> The police **were able to** find out that he could speak French and Italian. (not The police could find out)

> He **couldn't** remember who he was.

`manage to` sometimes is used to show that something is _difficult to achieve_:

> I've finally **manage to** give up smoking after all these years!

`be able to` or `manage to` are used with perfect or future forms:

> Apparently he**'s been able to** find his family.

> Within a year he**'ll** probably **be able to** remember quite a lot. (**not** Within a year he can probably remember quite a lot)

##Other uses of can

`can` can be used to mean `sometimes`:

> People can do funny things when they've experienced something terrible. (= People sometimes do funny things)

`can` also be used to _ask for and give permission_:

> **Can I** borrow the car this afternoon?

> **You can** borrow it, but I need it later this evening.

##Possibility

Use `must`, `may`, `might`, `could`, `couldn't` and `can't` when there is **some evidence**, **information**, or **belief** that _something is probably_ or _possibly_ true (or not). The modal verb to be used depends on the strength of the evidence to support the ideas.

|Strength|Modal verbs|
|:-------|:-------|
|very likely|`must`|
|possible|`might`, `may`, `could`, `may not`, `might not`|
|very unlikely|`can't`, `couldn't`|

`could`, `may,` and `might` express the _same degree of possibility_:

> He **may/might/could** remember some things already.

`couldn't` expresses the same probability as `can't`. It is usually used to _talk about the past_:

> The police realised he **couldn't** be Canadian. (= it was very unlikely that he was a Canadian)

**!** `may not` and `might not` **do not** express the **same probability** as `couldn't`:

> The supermarket **may/might not** be open today because it's a Bank Holiday. (**not** the supermarket couldn't be open)

####Present

`may (not)`, `might (not)`, `couldn't`, `must`, `can't` + `infinitive` without `to` to talk about possibility in the present:

> He **may remember** some things already. (= it is possible he remembers some things now)

> It **can't be** very easy living with someone who doesn't remember any of the past. (= it is very unlikely that it is easy)

`may (not)`, `might (not)`, `couldn't`, `must`, `can't` + `be` + `-ing` to talk about things (possibly) happening or in progress at the time of speaking:

> They **must be having** a difficult time adjusting to it all.

> The phone is engaged. She **might be talking** to her sister on the phone.

####Past

`may (not)`, `might (not)`, `couldn't`, `must`, `can't` + `have` + `past participle` to talk about things possibly in the past:

> In the attack he **must have hit** his head. (= there is strong evidence that he hit his head)

> He **could have had** a wife and children. (this is a possible situation)

> He **can't have been** married. (= there is strong evidence that he wasn't married)

`may (not)`, `might (not)`, `couldn't`, `must`, `can't` + `have been` + `-ing` to talk about things possibly happening or in progress in the past:

> He **might have been trying** to run away from his past.

####Future

`may (not)`, `might (not)`, and `could (not)` + `infinitive` without `to` to talk about possibility or uncertainty in the future:

> He **could make** a total recovery one day.

`may (not)`, `might (not)`, `could (not)`, `must`, `can't` + `be` + `-ing` to talk about things **possibly happening at a time** in the future:

> I **might be meeting** John later.

##Expressing possibility and opinions in written texts

Modal are very important in written texts because the _"soften"_ the message and help to show that the author is **expressing an opinion** rather than a proven fact. `May` is very common in these kind of texts as well as `can` used to mean _'sometimes'_.

Example for compare sentences:

|Sentence|Mean|
|:-----|:-----|
|People **are unkind** about their colleagues but it **is simply** because they are feeling insecure at work.|Treated as proven fact|
|People **can be unkind** about their colleagues but it **may simply be** because they are feeling insecure at work.|Expressing opinion|
|Banning cars with high fuel consumption **is** a good idea, as it **will result** in less pollution.|Very strong opinion|
|Banning cars with high fuel consumption **may be** a good idea, as it **could result** in less pollution.|Make opinion softer|

##Alternatives to modals

Adverbs like `certainly`, `probably`, `possibly`, `perhaps` and `maybe` can be used to express similar ideas to modal verbs:

> He had **probably** been attacked and robbed. (= he must have been attacked)

`it + be + certain/likely/probable/possible/impossible` can be used to express ability, probability and possibility:

> **It is possible** to program your computer to translate texts automatically. (= you can program you computer...)

> **It is possible** that the train will be late. (= the train might be late)

##Obligation and necessity

Expressions of obligation and necessity are used when there is a need to do something. This need can be internal (the speaker feels it is necessary) or external (rule or the situation make it necessary).

The verb `must (mustn't)`, `have to`, `have got to`, and `need to` express obligation and necessity:

> You**'ll need to** allow a bit of extra time to get over jet lag.

> You **have to** get a work permit before you go.

> You **mustn't** dress too casually for work.

`Must` is a modal verb and its form doesn't change:

> He **must** try a bit harder. (**not** he musts)

`must` is used when **the obligation comes from the speaker**:

> You **must** invite me to visit you (the speaker want this)

When there is an **institutional rule** or a **law**, `have to` or `need to` are more common than `must`:

> You **have to** get a work permit before you go. (this is a rule)

`Have to` is more common in spoken English than `must`, but in written English either is used. `Have got to` is more common in spoken English than written English:

> I**'ve got to** find somewhere to live quite quickly.

`Must` is _usually used_ on **signs, notices and printed information**:

> All employees **must** hold a valid work permit.

`must (mustn't)`, `have to`, `have got to`, and `need to` can be used to talk about **obligation and necessity in the present**. `have to` or `need to` are used with **past and future tenses**:

> You **will have to learn** some Cantonese. (**not** You will must learn)

> He **had to get up** really early to catch the ferry to work. (**not** He must got up early)

`must` and `ought to` do not usually used to make questions:

> What sort of things **do you need to** know? (**not** What sort of things must you/ought you to know?)

##No Obligation

`not have to`, `not need to` and `needn't` are used to suggest that there is **no obligation or necessity** to do something:

> You **needn't** buy lots of guide books before you go. (= it is not necessary to buy guide books before you go)

**!** `Mustn't` **does not** mean the same as `don't have to`, `don't need to` and `needn't`:

> You **don't have to** wait for ages. (= it is not necessary to wait)

> You **mustn't** wait here. (= it is not allowed to wait here)

`needn't have + past participle`, `didn't need to` or `didn't have to` can be used to talk about lack of obligation in the past:

> We **didn't have to** worry about work permits when I was there.

> I **needn't have bothered** to get a work permit. (= it wasn't necessary)

`didn't need to` are different from `needn't have`:

> John picked me up from the station so I **didn't need to get** a taxi home. (= it wasn't necessary so I didn't get a taxi)

> I **needn't have got** a taxi because John's flat wasn't far from the station. (= I got a taxi but it wasn't necessary)

To talk about the future, use `not have to` or `not need to`:

> I hope I **won't have to** work late tonight.

> He**'s not going to need to** come to the meeting after all.

##Suggestions and advice

`should(n't)` and `ought (not) to`  can be used to make suggestions or give advice:

> You **should** try and use it whenever you can. (= I think it is a good idea)

> You **ought to** take lots of passport photos with you.

> You **shouldn't** dress casually for work.

`must` is used to give strong advice:

> You **must** phone me when you get there.

##Adverbs

Adverbs like `also`, `always`, `never`, `sometimes`, `just` and `only` come after modal verbs:

> You **should always** carry plenty of loose change.

> You **must never** do that again.

use `really` before modal verb to add extra emphasis:

> You **really have to** see it to believe it.

##Formal written English

Verb of obligation, necessity and suggestion are common in formal and academic writing when giving opinions:

> Governments **should** take advice from the experts before making new laws.

> Companies **need to** consider cultural differences when engaging in business with overseas organizations.
