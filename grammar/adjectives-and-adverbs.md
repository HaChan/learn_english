#Adjectives and adverbs

##Adjectives

Adjectives describe nouns.

###How adjectives are used

- **before nouns**:

  > There are so many **historical buildings**.

  > It was well worth the trip, especially if you like **local crafts**.

- after the following verbs: `be`, become`, `get`, `seem`, `appear`, `look`, `smell`, `taste`, `feel`

  > The mosques in particular **are very beautiful**.

  > They always **seem pleased** to see you.

- after `find/make/keep` + object:

  > Work hard on your research if you want to **make your trip enjoyable** and **rewarding**.

  > I **found the insects** rather **frightening**.

- With other adjectives or with other nouns to describe a noun:

  > a **long**, **tiring boat ride** (adjective + adjective + noun + noun)

###The order of adjectives

- When adjectives is used together, words which _express opinion_ are **put before** words which _describe the characteristics_ or _type_ of what is talked about:

  > a **beautiful Turkish** carpet (_beautiful_ = opinion + _Turkish_ = type, not a Turkish beautiful carpet)

- _Nouns_ is often _used as adjectives_ to _add information_ about _type_:

  > the Gujarati **Textile Museum**

- When more than one adjective is used to describe characteristics or type, they usually follow this order:

        size -> temperature -> age -> shape -> colour -> nationality -> material -> type

  > Indian silk embroidery, small mountain villages

  > hot black coffee, a beautiful old round table

- When there are two or more adjectives after a verb or noun, `and` is used between the last two:

  > The people are very **welcoming and friendly** toward visitors.

  `and` is also used between two colours:

  > vivid **blue and green** feathers

###Adjectives ending in _-ed_ and _-ing_

Some _adjectives connected with feelings_ are **formed from verbs** and have **two possible forms**, usually `-ed` or `-ing` e.g. _tired/tiring_.

- `-ed` is used to talk about how people feel:

  > I was **fascinated** to see the extraordinary range of patterns.

  > I was **amazed** at the variety of wonderful animals.

- `-ing` describe the cause of the feelings (things or people):

  > It's an absolutely **amazing** city to visit.

  > India is a **fascinating** country

##Adverbs

Adverbs _give information_ about _verbs_, _adjectives_ or _other adverbs_. Adverbs tell about `how` (manner), `where` (place), `when` (time), `how often` (frequency), or `how much (intensity) something happens or is done. An adverb can be a single word (`sometimes`) or a phrase (`from time to time`).

####How adverbs are used

Adverbs which tell about:

- **manner** are _often formed by adding_ `-ly` to the adjective form:

  > careful -> carefully;   happy -> happily

  They **usually come after** the verb (and object, if there is one):

  > I plan _my trips_ **very carefully**.

- **place** usually _come after the verb_:

  > It was the first time I _had been_ **there**.

  > Try to _stay_ **near the old part of the city**.

- **time** such as `today`, `tomorow`, `now`, `since 2015`, `for three minutes`, _can go_ at the **beginning** or the **end** of a clause:

  > I had a very memorable trip **last year**. (or **Last year** I had a very memorable trip)

- **frequency** usually _come before the verb_ but _after_ `be` or and auxiliary verb:

  > I **often** _travel_ for my job.

  > I _have_ **always enjoyed** my visits there.

  > He_'s_ **never** late.

- **intensity** affect the strength of adjectives or adverbs:

          fairly, quite     very, extremely,
          rather, pretty    highly, really      absolutely,completely,totally

          weaker                                stronger

The **adverbs at the stronger** end of the scale (`absolutely`, `completely`, `totally`) can _only be used with some adjectives_. These tend to be **_'extreme`_ adjectives** that suggest a limit in their meaning (e.g. `terrifying`, `excellent`, `exhausted`). Other _'non extreme'_ adjectives (e.g. `frightened`, `good`, `tired`) never collocate with these stronger adverbs. Compare:

> There are some **absolutely stunning** examples of Indian silk embroidery. (not fairly stunning)

> The people are **very friendly**. (not absolutely friendly)

`Really` collocates with most adjectives.

**!** Adjectives or nouns which describe type cannot be intensified. (not a very Textile Museum)

####The order of adverbs

When two or more adverbs are used together at the end of a clause the order is usually `manner -> place -> time`:

> I'll meet you **outside the station at six o'clock**. (outside the station = place, at six o'clock = time)

####Irregular adverbs

Some adverbs of manner look the same as the adjective form (e.g. `hard`, `fast`, `straight`, `late`, `early`):

> Work **hard** on your research. (adverb)

> This is a **hard** exercise. (adjective)

_Hard_ is an adjective and an adverb, and _hardly_ is an adverb meaning _very little_:

> He **hardly** had time to say hello. (= he had very little time to say hello)

_Good_ is an adjective, and _well_ is the adverb:

> He spoke **very good** English. (describe English)

> He spoke English **very well**. (describe how he speak English)

However, `well` can also be an adjective when talking about health:

> She is not **well** - she's got a cold.

####Grammar extra: Adjectives

Some adjectives can be followed by `to` + infinitive to add to their meaning (e.g. `able`, `likely`, `wrong`, `lucky`) and some adjectives describing feelings (e.g. `surprised`, `afraid`, `happy`, `delighted`):

> I'll be **happy** _to answer_ questions.

> I was **fascinated** _to see_ the extraordinary range of patterns

Some adjectives can be followed by a preposition + `-ing` [Unit Preposition]():

> People are **tired of hearing** politicians' promises

> I am not **very good at taking** photographs.
