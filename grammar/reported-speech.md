#Reported speech

Reported speech can be used to report in writing or speech what someone has said.

##Tense changes

When reporting what someone has said, the tense of the main verb sometimes be changed, it moved _"back"_ one tense:

|Original tense of main verb|Tense in reported speech|
|:---------|:---------|
|**present simple**:<br>I **live** in Italy |**past simple**:<br>She said she **lived** in Italy.|
|**present continuous**:<br>I**'m living** in Italy.|**past continuous**:<br>He said he **was living** in Italy.|
|**past simple**:<br>I **lived** in Italy|**past perfect**:<br>She said she **had lived** in Italy|
|**past continuous**:<br>I **was living** in Italy|**past perfect continuous**:<br>He said he **had been living** in Italy|
|**present perfect**:<br>I**'ve lived** in Italy|**past perfect**:<br>She said she**'d lived** in Italy|
|**past perfect**:<br>I **had lived** in Italy|**past perfect**:<br>He said he **had lived** in Italy|
|**be going to**:<br>I**'m going to live** in Italy|**was/were going to**:<br>She said she **was going to live** in Italy|
|**will**:<br>I **will live** in Italy|**would**:<br>He said he **would live** in Italy|
|**may/might**:<br>I **may/might live** in Italy next year|**might**:<br>She **might live** in Italy next year.
|**can**:<br>I **can live** in Italy|**could**:<br>He said he **could live** in Italy|
|**must**:<br>I **must live** in Italy|**had to**:<br>She said she **had to live** in Italy|

Tense is not often changed because:

  - **things are being talked about remains true**:

  > This **has** nothing to do with the figures.

  > => He said that the job losses **have** noting to do with the figures. (at the time of reporting this fact is still true)

  - the **original tense** was **past simple** or **past continuous**:

  > we **decided** to change the way we operate our business two years ago.

  > => West claimed that they **decided** to make changes two years ago.

##Reporting verbs

When reporting what someone has said, the same words that used in the original speech are unlikely to be used. Many different reporting verbs can help conveying the general idea using fewer words than in the original speech. Here are some common verbs:

  - **reporting verb (+that)**

  `agree`, `admit`, `announce`, `argue`, `believe`, `claim`, `complain`, `deny`, `explain`, `insist`, `promise`, `propose`, `reply`, `request`, `say`, `state`, `suggest`, `think`, `warn`

  > The director **claimed (that)** they decided to make the changes two years ago

  - **reporting verb + someone + _that_**

  `assure`, `inform`, `persuade`, `remind`, `tell`

  > He **assured the interviewer that** the company would continue to operate in the future.

  - **reporting verb** + **_to_-infinitive**

  `agree`, `ask`, `claim`, `offer`, `promise`, `propose`, `refuse`

  > He **promised to do** his best for the employees.

  - **reporting verb** + **someone** + **_to_-infinitive**

  `advise`, `ask`, `encourage`, `invite`, `persuade`, `remind`, `tell`, `urge`, `warn`

  > They **urged the employees** to stay calm.

  - **reporting verb** + **preposition** + **_-ing_/noun**

  `argue about`, `complain about`:

  > He **complained about the terrible food**

  `apologise for`:

  > The company **apologised for** caus**ing** redundancies.

  `insist on`:

  > The manager **insisted on** see**ing** the staff.

  `complain to`: He **complained to the manager**.

  - **reporting verb** + **someone** + **preposition** + **_-ing_/noun**

  `accuse of`:

  > They **accused the company of** plann**ing** badly.

  `advise about`, `remind about`:

  > They **reminded her about the meeting**

  `advise on`, `congratulate on`:

  > He **advised me on the deal**.

  `blame for`, `thank for`: They **thanked her for** com**ing**.

  - **reporting verb** + **_-ing_/noun**

  `accept`, `admit`, `deny`, `suggest`

  > The director **denied** hav**ing** financial problems.

  > The employees **accepted the offer** of early redundancy.

  - **reporting verb** + **someone (+ noun)**

  `offer`, `promise`, `refuse`:

  > He **offered her a job**

:warning: Some of the same verbs can be used in different ways (e.g `admit`, `claim` , `offer`, `persuade`)

> West **claimed that they decided** to make the changes two years ago.

> West **claimed to have decided** to make the changes two years ago.

##Time references etc.

If words or phrases in reported speech are reported at a different time from the original words, they needed to be change:

`today` -> `that day`

`tomorrow` -> `the following day/the next day`

`yesterday` -> `the day before`

`next week` -> `the following week`

`now` -> `then/straight away`

`this` -> `that`

`here` -> `there`

> He said he would see me **tomorrow**. (reported on the same day)

> He said he would see me **the next day**. (reported at a later date)

Sometimes the context requires pronouns to change:

> **I** like **you**   ->   **He** said **he** liked **her**

##Reporting questions

Use statement word order when reporting questions:

> I asked Mr West **how he was going to** deal with the problem. (**not** I asked Mr West how was he going to ...)

To report questions with question words (who, what, where, why, when, how), the question word is kept:

> **What** has led to this situation?

> The interviewer asked **what** had let to this situation.

`if` or `whether` can be used to report **yes/no questions**:

> Are these cuts a result of Angleside's poor performance over the past five years?

> I asked **if/whether** these cuts were the result of Angleside's poor performance over the past five years.

:warning: Do not use question mark for reported questions.

**Grammar extra: Other ways of reporting**

Other expressions can be used to report speech, e.g. `according to`, `apparently`, `supposedly`, `seemingly` (more common in spoken English):

> **According to** the radio programme, they are cutting 150 jobs.
