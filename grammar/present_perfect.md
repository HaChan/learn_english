#Present perfect tenses

Present perfect tenses is used when we want to **show a link** between the present and the past.

##Present perfect simple

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _have/has_ + past participle | She **has started** the assignment |
|`-`| _have/has not_ + past participle | I **haven't started** the assignment |
|`?`| _have/has_... + past participle? | **Have** you **started** the assignment |

Use cases:

- To talk about **a time period** that is **not finished** (e.g. _today_, _this week_):

  > I**'ve written** a rough plan this morning. (It is still morning when I am writing this plan)

- To show that something **happened at some point in the past before now**. We do not state when it happened:

  > I **have collected** plenty of information. (at some point before now and I will use it to write my essay)

  Often used time expression: _ever_, _never_, _before_, _up to now_, _still_, _so far_.

  > It is the longest I have ever had to write. (at any point before now)

  !If we state when something happened, we must use the simple past:

  > I **wasted** a lot of time last week.

- To talk about a **present situation** which **started in the past** usually with _for/since_:

  > I **have worked** really hard for the last two weeks. (I have worked hard till now)

  _for_ is used with a length of time (e.g. for two hour, for three days...) and _since_ with a point in time (e.g. since 2001, since Monday...)

- To talk about something that **happened** at an **unstated time in the past** but is connected to the present:

  > I **have read** all the books on the reading list. (I have the notes now)

  Often used time expression: _recently_, _just_, _already_, and _yet_ with negatives or questions.

  > I **have just got** up

  > **Have** you **written** your assignment yet?

Compare the use of the present perfect with the past simple:

|Present perfect|Past simple|
|------|-------|
| **links the past with the present** | **only talks about the past** |
| I have made quite a lot of notes (at some point before now and I may have take more notes)| I made notes on the most important things. (when I did the reading and I have finished making notes)|
| **does not talk about a specific time in the past** | **states a  specific past time, or the time is understood** |
| Have you read the leaflet? (at some time before now) | I read the leaflets _when I was in the library_ (I am not in the library now and the reading is finished)|
| **uses time expressions the show the time period is unfinished** | **uses time expressions that show the time is finished** |
| I have read six articles _this week_. (the week is not finished) | I read five books last week. (last week has finished) |

**Note** the position of the time expressions that occur with the present perfect:

- between the auxiliary and main verb (e.g. _recently, _already_, _always_, _ever_, _just_, _never_)

  > I have **already** written the notes.

  > I have **just** finished my essay.

  _Ever_ is generally used with questions or negatives:

  > Have you **ever** been to Buenos Aires?

- after the main verb (e.g. _all my life_, _every day_, _yet_, _before_, _for ages_...)

  > I have felt tired **for weeks**.

  > I have not flown **before**

  If there is an object clause, the time expression comes at the end:

  > I have gone to bed early **every night since then**.

  > I have written more than ten assignments **since I started this course**.

##Present perfect continuous

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _have/has been_ + verb + -ing | I**'ve been studying** really hard. |
|`-`| _have/has not been_ + verb + -ing | He **hasn't been studying** really hard. |
|`?`| _have/has ... been_ + verb + -ing? | **Have** you **been studying** really hard? |

Both `present perfect simple` and `present perfect continuous` can be used to say how long a situation or activity has been going on (often with **for** or **since**)

  > I **have** felt tired **for** weeks.

  > I **have been feeling** tired **since** I started this course.

  > I **have worked** at the restaurant **since** I moved here.

  > I **have been working** at the restaurant **for** three years.

The different uses of the _present perfect simple_ and the _present perfect continuous_:

|Present perfect continuous|Present perfect simple|
|------|-------|
|**emphasises how long**|**says how many times**|
|I have been reading for the past two weeks.|I have read three articles.|
|**focuses on the activity itself (it does not show whether the activity is completed or not)|focuses on the result or completion of the activity|
|I have been writting my essay. (we do not know if the essay is finished or not)|I have written my essay. (the essay is finished but we do not know when)|
|What have you been doing? (a person is interested in the activity that other person made)|What have you done? (a person is interested in the result of the action that other person made)|

**!Note** State verbs do not generally have a continuous form:

  > I **have known** them since I was a child. ( **not** I have been knowing them ...)

**Grammar Extra**:

Use the present perfect tense with the following structures: `it/this/that is the (first, second, best, only, worst ...)`

  > **It is the first time** I **have ever** had to write such a long assingment.

  > **Is this the only time** you **have travelled** aboard?

  > **That is the sixth cup of coffe** you **have had** today.
