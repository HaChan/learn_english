#Past tenses

##Past simple

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| verb + _-ed_ (or -d) | He **worked** for the police |
|`-`| did not + verb | She **did not work** for the police |
|`?`| did... + verb? | **Did** they **work** for the police |

**Irregular verbs**

Many verbs are irregular: **went** (go), **came** (come), **wrote** (write)

The verb **be** is irregular: _I/he/she/it_ **was**; _you/we/they_ **were**

Use past simple when:

- To talk about **single past completed actions**. _Often the time is mentioned_:

    > A few weeks ago a woman **called** to report a robbery at her house.

    But no time reference is necessary if it is already known:

    > How **did** the burglar **break** in without anybody hearing him? (in the previous story)

- To give **a series of actions** in the order that they happened:

    > The burglar **came in** through the front door, **picked up** the woman's handbag, **emptied** it out and **stole** her purse.

    The words like _next_ or _then_ are often used to indicate the sequence of event.

    > **Then**, the burglar **went** into the front room, **opened** all the cupboards and **took** a valuable collections of CDs.

- To talk about past **repeated actions**:

    > When her son got older he **often** **went out** to visit his friends after school

    **Used to** and **would** can also be used.

- To talk about **long-term situations in the past** which are **no longer true**:

    > Bill Murphy **worked** for the police force for over 17 years.

    > Explorers at that time **believed** that the world was flat.

    **Used to** and **would** can also be used.

##Past continuous

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| was/were + verb + -ing | She was watching the news |
|`-`| was/were not + verb + -ing | They weren't watching the news|
|`?`| was/were... + verb + -ing? |Were you watching the news|

Used went:

- To **provied the background scene** to an action or event (usually in the past simple). Words like: **when**, **while**, and **as** are often used:

    > It happened at five in the afternoon **while** she **was watching** the news on TV.

    > He **was doing** his homework in his bedroom **when** the burglar came into the house.

    It is possible to have multiple background scene happening at the same time:

    > He **was listening** to music and **working** on his computer.

- Emphasize the activity **without focusing** on its **completion**. Compare:

    > For a while last year I **was working** at the cinema, **studying** for my degree and writing a column for the local newspaper. (we don't know if the actions were completed or not, or whether they happened at the same time)

    > Last year I **worked** at the cinema, **studied** for my degree and **wrote** a column for the local newspaper. (suggest all the jobs are now completed, and probably happened in that order)

**!Note**: State verbs do not generally have a continuous form.

##Used to and would

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| used to/would + infinitive | She used to / would lock the door |
|`-`| did not + used to + infinitive | I didn't used to lock the door|
|`?`| did... + used to + infinitive? | **Did** they used to lock the door? |

Used when:

- `used to + infinitive` or `would + infinitive` are used to talk about past repeated actions:

  > She **used to keep** the front door locked. (but she stopped doing this)

  > She **would leave** the door unlooked whenever she was at home.

  ! `Would` is unusual in the negative form and in `Yes/No` questions.

- `used to infinitive` is used to talk about permanent situations that are usually no longer true:

  > Bill Murphy **used to** work for the police force. (but he does not now)

- Do not use `used to` to talk about how long the situation lasted:

  > Bill Murphy **worked** for the police force for over 17 years. (**not** Bill Murphy used to work for the police force for over 17 years)

! Do not use `would` with the state verbs.

##Past perfect simple

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _had_ + past participle | They **had listened** to his music. |
|`-`| _had not_ + past participle | They **had not listened** to his music. |
|`?`| _had..._ + past participle? | **Had** they **listened** to his music? |

Past perfect simple is used:

  - when talking about the past and want to mention something that happened earlier:

  > His father was a composer and his grandfather **had** also **been** a musician. (the person grandfather was a musician and then later his father became a composer)

  Sometime we use words like `just` or `already`. Notice that these adverbs go **between the auxiliary** and the **main verb**:

  > By the time he was 17, Mozart's reputation **had already begun** to spread through Europe.

  ! Use the past simple tense if the **events are mentioned in chronological order**:

  > His grandfather **was** a musician and his father **was** also a composer.


  - with words like `when`, `as soon as`, `by the time`, `after` to show the order of events:

  > When Mozart was born. five of his siblings **had** already **killed**. (Mozart's siblings died first, then Mozart was born)

  !Notice the difference in meaning between these two sentences:

  > When I got home, my husband **cooked** dinner. (= I got home and then my husband cooked dinner)

  > When I got home, my husband **had cooked** dinner. (= my husband cooked dinner before I got home)

  - to talk about an **indefinite time before a particular point** in the past, often with words like `always`, `sometime`, `never`, `before`, `by + fixed time`:

  > His family were richer than they **had ever been before**. (= they were not as rich at any time before this point in the past)

  > **By the time** he was six, the little boy **had written** a composition of his own.

  - to **report past events** using reporting verbs [Unit 15]():

  > The man told me he **had met** my father a long time before.

##Past perfect continuous

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _had been_ + verb + ing | She'**d been studying** for ages. |
|`-`| _had not been_ + verb + ing | He **hadn't been studying** for long. |
|`?`| _had...been_ + verb + ing? | **Had** you **been studying** for long? |

The past perfect continuous is used to focus on **how long an activity continued** or to focus on **the activity itself**:

  > Times were hard and the family **had been struggling for some time**. (to show how long)

  > Mozart's sister was extremely gifted at the keyboard and she **had been making excellent progress**. (focus on the activity)

!**Do not** use past perfect continuous to say **how many times something happened**:

  > I knew the way as **I had visited** her several times before. (not I knew the way as I had been visiting her several times)

!State verbs do not generally have a continuous form.

**Grammar extra: Unfulfilled hopes**

We use the past perfect to talk about past disappointments or things that did not happen as expected:

  > The politician **had expected** to be re-elected, but in the end she only got ten per cent of the vote.

  > I **had been hoping** to go with my brother on his trip but I was too sick to go.
