#Past tenses

##Past simple

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| verb + _-ed_ (or -d) | He **worked** for the police |
|`-`| did not + verb | She **did not work** for the police |
|`?`| did... + verb? | **Did** they **work** for the police |

**Irregular verbs**

Many verbs are irregular: **went** (go), **came** (come), **wrote** (write)

The verb **be** is irregular: _I/he/she/it_ **was**; _you/we/they_ **were**

Use past simple when:

- To talk about **single past completed actions**. _Often the time is mentioned_:

    > A few weeks ago a woman **called** to report a robbery at her house.

    But no time reference is necessary if it is already known:

    > How **did** the burglar **break** in without anybody hearing him? (in the previous story)

- To give **a series of actions** in the order that they happened:

    > The burglar **came in** through the front door, **picked up** the woman's handbag, **emptied** it out and **stole** her purse.

    The words like _next_ or _then_ are often used to indicate the sequence of event.

    > **Then**, the burglar **went** into the front room, **opened** all the cupboards and **took** a valuable collections of CDs.

- To talk about past **repeated actions**:

    > When her son got older he **often** **went out** to visit his friends after school

    **Used to** and **would** can also be used.

- To talk about **long-term situations in the past** which are **no longer true**:

    > Bill Murphy **worked** for the police force for over 17 years.

    > Explorers at that time **believed** that the world was flat.

    **Used to** and **would** can also be used.

##Past continuous

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| was/were + verb + -ing | She was watching the news |
|`-`| was/were not + verb + -ing | They weren't watching the news|
|`?`| was/were... + verb + -ing? |Were you watching the news|

Used went:

- To **provied the background scene** to an action or event (usually in the past simple). Words like: **when**, **while**, and **as** are often used:

    > It happened at five in the afternoon **while** she **was watching** the news on TV.

    > He **was doing** his homework in his bedroom **when** the burglar came into the house.

    It is possible to have multiple background scene happening at the same time:

    > He **was listening** to music and **working** on his computer.

- Emphasize the activity **without focusing** on its **completion**. Compare:

    > For a while last year I **was working** at the cinema, **studing** for my degree and writing a column for the local newspaper. (we don't know if the actions were completed or not, or whether they happened at the same time)

    > Last year I **worked** at the cinema, **studied** for my degree and **wrote** a column for the local newspaper. (suggest all the jobs are now completed, and probably happened in that order)

**!Note**: State verbs do not generally have a continuous form.

##Used to and would

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| used to/would + infinitive | She used to / would lock the door |
|`-`| did not + used to + infinitive | I didn't used to lock the door|
|`?`| did... + used to + infinitive? | **Did** they used to lock the door? |

Used when:

- `used to + infinitive` or `would + infinitive` are used to talk about past repeated actions:

  > She **used to keep** the front door locked. (but she stopped doing this)

  > She **would leave** the door unlooked whenever she was at home.

  ! `Would` is unusual in the negative form and in `Yes/No` questions.

- `used to infinitive` is used to talk about permanent situations that are usually no longer true:

  > Bill Murphy **used to** work for the police force. (but he does not now)

- Do not use `used to` to talk about how long the situation lasted:

  > Bill Murphy **worked** for the police force for over 17 years. (**not** Bill Murphy used to work for the police force for over 17 years)

! Do not use `would` with the state verbs.
