#The noun phrase

A noun phrase is a _group of words_ with **a noun** as its **main part**.  Information about the noun can be before the noun and/or after the noun.

Information that comes before the noun in a noun phrase is usually expressed through:

  - deteminers [Referring to nouns]():

  > **this** horrible rubbish.

  - adjectives and adverbs:

  > a **rich** habitat

Information that comes after the noun is usually expressed through:

  - prepositional phrases:

  > an abundance **of** creatures

  - past participle clauses:

  > the rubbish **contained** in the harbour

  - present participle (_-ing_) clauses:

  > the rubbish **lying** at the bottom of the harbour

  - to-infinitive clause:

  > a decision **to expand**

##Noun + prepositional phrase

Information can be added after a noun by using a prepositional phrase. Common prepositions are: `of`, `in`, `for`, `on`, `to`, `with`:

  > _possible sites_ **with submerged rubbish**

  > _a rich habitat_ **for an abundance of creatures**

`Of` is the most common preposition used in prepositional noun phrases. It is _used_ **after nouns of quantity** or **containers**:

  > the **number of** fish, an **abundance of** creatures (quantities)

  > a **bottle of** water,  a **packet of** biscuits (containers)


`Of` can also be used to **show belonging or possession**:

  > the rubbish **of the past** (not the past's rubble)

  > particular areas **of the harbour**

`at`, `in`, `on` are often used to talk about **physical location**:

  > this rubbish lying **at the bottom** of the harbour

  > different species living **in Sydney Harbour**

Prepositional phrases containing `with` often express the same information as a relative clause with the main verb `have`:

  > harbour sites **with submerged rubbish** (= harbour sites which have submerged rubbish)

  > sea tulips **with bright red bodies** (= sea tulips which have bright red bodies)

##Noun + past participle clause

_A past participle clause_ gives the **same information** as a _relative clause with a passive verb_:

> all of the rubbish **contained in the harbour** (= rubbish which is contained in the harbour)

> areas **cleared of rubbish** (= areas which have been cleared of rubbish)

> the data **collected from the sites** (= the data which is collected from the sites)

In both spoken and written English using a `noun + past participle` clause is more common than the equivalent relative clause (express the same information in fewer words)

##Noun + present participle (-ing) clause

A _present participle clause_ can give the **same information** as a _relative clause with an active verb_, often in the present or past continuous:

> the other debris **lying on the sea floor** (= the other debris which is lying on the sea floor)

The `noun + present participle` clause is more common than the equivalent relative clause.

##Noun + to-infinitive clause

_To_-infinitive clauses are used to **show a purpose** or **intention** and usually follow nouns of _time_, _place_, _manner_ and _quantity_:

> time **to go**

> the place **to visit**

> a way **to look at it**

> a lot **to look at**

Nouns followed by the _to_-infinitive are related to verbs also followed by the _to_-infinitive (e.g. _decide/decision_; _plan/plan_)

> a decision **to expand** (decide to)

> our plan **to build** a new hospital (plan to)
