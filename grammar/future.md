#Future tense

###Present continuous

Present continuous is used to talk about **plans or definite arrangements** for the **future**:

  > We**'er staying** in a small hotel. (we have made the arrangements)

Notice that time expressions are used or understood from the context in order to show that we are talking about the future (and not the present):

  > The manager **is having** a party just after we get back. (time expression given)

  > We**'re playing** four matches there. (future time expression understood)

###Will

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _will_ + verb | We**'ll enjoy** it|
|`-`| _will not (won't)_ + verb | He **won't enjoy** it|
|`?`| _will_... + verb? | **Will** they **enjoy** it?|

Used when:

  - To **make predictions**, usually **based on** our **opinions** or our **past experience**:

  > I think it**'ll be** extremely hot there.

  - to talk about **future event** we **haven't arranged** yet:

  > We**'ll** probably **stay** in some sort of mountain lodge there.

  - to talk about **future events** or **facts** that are **not personal**:

  > The best player on the tour **will get** a special trophy.

  > The prime minister **will open** the debate in parliament tomorrow.

  - to talk about something we decide to do at the time of speaking:

  > Tell me all about it and I**'ll pass on** the information to the rest of the team.

  Use _will_ to make **offers**, **promises** or **suggestions**:

  > Don't worry, I**'ll let** everyone know. (a promise)

###Going to

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _am/is/are_ + _going to_ + verb | We**'ll enjoy** it|
|`-`| _am/is/are not_ + _going to_ + verb | He **won't enjoy** it|
|`?`| _am/is/are_... + _going to_ + verb? | **Will** they **enjoy** it?|

_Going to_ often means the same as the present _continuous_ and _will_

`Going to` is used when:

  - to talk about **events in the future** we have **already thought** about and **intend to do**:

  > We**'going to hire** a bus (we intend to go but we haven't mead the arrangements yet)

  > We're **going to get** a boat to a couple of the islands.

  - to **make predictions** when there is **present evidence**:

  > Well, we**'re** certainly **going to have** a varied trip. (I am judging this from what I know about the plans)

`Going to` and `will` can follow words like: `think`, `doubt`, `expect`, `believe`, `probably`, `certainly`, `definitely`, `be sure` to show that it is an opinion about the future:

  > I **think** it **is going to be** a great trip.

  > I **am sure** we **will enjoy** it whatever the weather.

  > It **will probably rain** every day.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Different future forms can be used to talk about the same future situation. It depends on the speaker's ideas about the situation:

`Present continuous` or `going to`?

  > The manager **is having** a party when we get back. (definite arrangements)


  > We**'re going** to hire a bus and then drive through the mountains. (less definite arrangements - we haven't booked the bus yet)


`Going to` or `will`?

  > I'm sure we**'ll enjoy** it (prediction based on my guess)


  > We**'re going** to have a very varied trip! (prediction based on what I know about the weather)

There is very little difference between `going to` and `will` for predictions.

------------------------------------------

**Grammar extra: Making predictions using words other than will**

In formal writing, we often use expressions other than `will` to predict the future (e.g. `be likely to`, `be predicted to`, `be estimated to`, `be certain to`):

  > The population **is likely to** increase to 22 million in 2011.

  > The average annual rainfall **is predicted to** be ten per cent lower than today's figures.

####Present simple

Use present simple with a future meaning:

  - to talk about **timetables** or **schedules**:

  > The conference only **lasts** three days.

  > The train to the airport **leaves** in 20 minutes.

  - **after conjunctions** such as `when`, `as soon as`, `after`, `before`, `until`, `as long as`:

  > I'll be feeling really nervous **when I get** to Rome (**not** when I will get to Rome)

  > Can you do it **before** we **have** the departmental meeting (not before we will have ...)

  Note that other present tenses are also possible:

  > I won't be able to relax **until** I**'m** actually **giving** my talk.

####Be about to

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _am/is/are about to_ + verb | I**'m about to go** to Rome |
|`-`| _am/is/are not about to_ + verb | I**'m not about to go** to Rome |
|`?`| _am/is/are_... + verb? | Are you **about to go** to Rome? |

`about to` is used to talk about something likely to happen in the immediate future:

  > I**'m about to go** to Rome for a conference. (I will be leaving very soon)

!Note: the negative form suggests the speaker has no intention of doing something:

  > I**'m not about to cancel** my trip. (I have no intention of cancelling my trip)

####Future continuous

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _will be_ + verb + ing | I**'ll be feeling** nervous |
|`-`| _will not (won't) be_ + verb ing | She **won't be feeling** nervous |
|`?`| _will_... be + verb + ing? | **Will** you **be feeling** nervous? |

Future continuous is used:

  - to **describe** or **predict events** or **situations** _continuing_ at a **particular point** in the future or **over a period** of time in the future.

  > I**'ll be working** on the report _all next week_.

  > I**'ll be thinking** of you _in Rome_.

  > _By the year 2015_ it is estimated that well over one billion people **will be learing** English

  - to talk about **events** that are **planned** or **already decided** (this use is similar to the present continuous for future arrangements):

  > I**'ll be seeing** Sarah at lunch.

####Future perfect simple

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _will have_ + past participle | I**'ll have done** it by then |
|`-`| _will not (won't) have_ + past participle | We **won't have done** it by then |
|`?`| _will_... have + past participle? | **Will** you **have done** it by then? |

Future perfect simple is used to _talk about_ a **future event** that will **finish before** a **specified time in the future**, often with `before`, `by` + fixed time, or `in` + amount of time:

> _By the end of the year_ I **will have given** the same talk at 6 conferences!

> I**'ll have finished** it _by next Friday_.

> _In a week's time_ I**'ll have written** the report.

####Future perfect continuous

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _will have been_ + verb + -ing | I**'ll have been studying** here for three months |
|`-`| _will not (won't) have been_ + verb + -ing | We **won't have been studying** here for long |
|`?`| _will_... have been + verb + -ing? | How long **will** you **have been studying** here? |

Future perfect continuous is used to show **how long** an _activity_ or _situation_ has been **in progress before a specified time** in the future. Usually mention the length of time:

> _By the end of the month_ I**'ll have been working** here _for three years_.


**Grammar extra: The future in the past**

`was/were going to`, `was/were planning to`, `was/were about to` + verb is used to talk about **something planned** which **did not** or **will not happen**:

> I **was going to leave** this morning but they cancelled my flight.

> We **were about to leave** when the phone rang.
