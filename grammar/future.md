#Future tense

###Present continuous

Present continuous is used to talk about **plans or definite arrangements** for the **future**:

  > We**'er staying** in a small hotel. (we have made the arrangements)

Notice that time expressions are used or understood from the context in order to show that we are talking about the future (and not the present):

  > The manager **is having** a party just after we get back. (time expression given)

  > We**'re playing** four matches there. (future time expression understood)

###Will

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _will_ + verb | We**'ll enjoy** it|
|`-`| _will not (won't)_ + verb | He **won't enjoy** it|
|`?`| _will_... + verb? | **Will** they **enjoy** it?|

Used when:

  - To **make predictions**, usually **based on** our **opinions** or our **past experience**:

  > I think it**'ll be** extremely hot there.

  - to talk about **future event** we **haven't arranged** yet:

  > We**'ll** probably **stay** in some sort of mountain lodge there.

  - to talk about **future events** or **facts** that are **not personal**:

  > The best player on the tour **will get** a special trophy.

  > The prime minister **will open** the debate in parliament tomorrow.

  - to talk about something we decide to do at the time of speaking:

  > Tell me all about it and I**'ll pass on** the information to the rest of the team.

  Use _will_ to make **offers**, **promises** or **suggestions**:

  > Don't worry, I**'ll let** everyone know. (a promise)

###Going to

|Sym|Form|Example|
|---|----|-------|
|`+`| _am/is/are_ + _going to_ + verb | We**'ll enjoy** it|
|`-`| _am/is/are not_ + _going to_ + verb | He **won't enjoy** it|
|`?`| _am/is/are_... + _going to_ + verb? | **Will** they **enjoy** it?|

_Going to_ often means the same as the present _continuous_ and _will_

`Going to` is used when:

  - to talk about **events in the future** we have **already thought** about and **intend to do**:

  > We**'going to hire** a bus (we intend to go but we haven't mead the arrangements yet)

  > We're **going to get** a boat to a couple of the islands.

  - to **make predictions** when there is **present evidence**:

  > Well, we**'re** certainly **going to have** a varied trip. (I am judging this from what I know about the plans)

`Going to` and `will` can follow words like: `think`, `doubt`, `expect`, `believe`, `probably`, `certainly`, `definitely`, `be sure` to show that it is an opinion about the future:

  > I **think** it **is going to be** a great trip.

  > I **am sure** we **will enjoy** it whatever the weather.

  > It **will probably rain** every day.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Different future forms can be used to talk about the same future situation. It depends on the speaker's ideas about the situation:

`Present continuous` or `going to`?

  > The manager **is having** a party when we get back. (definite arrangements)


  > We**'re going** to hire a bus and then drive through the mountains. (less definite arrangements - we haven't booked the bus yet)


`Going to` or `will`?

  > I'm sure we**'ll enjoy** it (prediction based on my guess)


  > We**'re going** to have a very varied trip! (prediction based on what I know about the weather)

There is very little difference between `going to` and `will` for predictions.

------------------------------------------

**Grammar extra: Making predictions using words other than will**

In formal writing, we often use expressions other than `will` to predict the future (e.g. `be likely to`, `be predicted to`, `be estimated to`, `be certain to`):

  > The population **is likely to** increase to 22 million in 2011.

  > The average annual rainfall **is predicted to** be ten per cent lower than today's figures.
