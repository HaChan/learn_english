##2 Some and any

####Some

- is generally used in positive statements: _There are **some shelves** above the desk_.

- can also be used in questions and particularly in requests and offers:

  _Would you like **some biscuits**?_

- means 'an unspecified (not large) amount':

  _It would be great to get **some money** to help with the rent. (we don't know how much money)_

**!** Use `some of` with other determiners (e.g. _my_, _the_, _these_) to refer to a particular group:

_**Some of my** students have part-time jobs._

####Any

- is usually used in negatives and questions:

  _My desk has **not** got **any drawers**_

  _Has your desk got **any drawers**?_

- can also be used in positive statements to mean 'it doesn't matter who/which/where/when':

  _Call me **any time** if you need futher help. (=it doesn't matter when you call)_

**!** `no + noun` can also be used to mean the same as `not... any`:

_My desk has got **no drawers**._ (= my desk hasn't got any drawers)

`no` can be used when the noun is a subject:

_**No applicants** had the neccessary experience for the job._ (not Not any applicants)

Word like `something/anything`, `somebody/anybody`, etc. follow the same rules as `some` and `any`.

**!** Use `a few of` with other determiners (e.g. `my`, `the`, `these`) to refer to a particular group:

> **A few of the rooms** have a sea view.

`Lots of/a lot of` are less formal than `much/many`:

> There are **lots of advertisements** for accommodation in the paper.

> **Many scientists** believe that global warming is having a negative impact on our climate.

**!** `lots of` is not usually used with negative statements:

**!** `much` is not usually used in positive sentences:

> I found **a lot of** information on the Internet. (not much information)

##Grammar extra: Nouns that can be both countable and uncountable

Sometimes the same noun can be either countable or uncountable depending on the meaning (e.g. `light`, `room`, `cake`, `time`). Materials and liquids can also be either (e.g. `glass`, `paper`, `coffee`, `wine`). Compare:

> The natural **light** is really nice. (uncountable)

> Both of the **lights** in the ceiling are really old. (countable)

> There isn't much **room** for a desk. (uncountable = space)

> We have two spare **rooms**. (countable = rooms in a house)

> Do you drink much **coffee**? (uncountable = in general)

> I'd like to order **a coffee**, please. (countable = a cup of coffee)
