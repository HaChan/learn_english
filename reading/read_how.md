#Pause and think methods

  1. Stop at interesting things: _a new word_, _how a word was used_, a grammatical structure, a preposition, an article, a conjunction, th order of words, etc. Example: think about why the sentence contains the preposition _at_, and not _on_. Why present perfect instead of past simple.

  2. If the sentence contains a useful phrase, ask yourself: **Could you produce a similar phrase yourself?** Would you use the right tenses, articles prepositions and right word order? It you are uncertain, read the phrase again. Practice saying it (or similar phrase).

  3. If necessary, use dictionary to find definitions of words in the sentence and get more example sentences.

  4. Adding the phrase to **SRS** collection.

**Important notes**

  - Don't use this method all the time. This reading modeis quite exhausting so don't do it when tired.

  - Don't try to focus on every phrase.

    + Some phrases are not useful. Some character have rare expression. Novels often contain literary language which is not useful for building sentences.

    + Some phrases are just too advance. Try to focus on things that are within your reach.

  - This technique will not always make you remember the particular type of sentences is problematic in English. If you remember that, it will at least make you stop before you write that sentence.

  - You shouldn't think about why something was phrased in a particular way. The goal is focus your attention at the sentences, not come up with grammar rules (even though you can)

**Example**:

Demonstration text 1:

> Former President Jimmy Carter will visit Venezuela next week to mediate talks between the government and its opposition, which have been locked in a power struggle since a failed coup

  - "Former President" - not "The Former President", so I guess we say “President Carter” and not “The President Carter”, even though we say "The President will do something" when we don’t mention his name

  - "to mediate talks" - not "to mediate in the talks" or something like that

  - "power struggle" - What does this mean?

  - "since a failed coup" — not "since the failed coup". The author does not assume we know about the coup.

  - "coup" - What is the meaning of this word

Demonstration text 2:

> Jennifer McCoy, of the Atlanta-based Carter Center, told reporters Saturday that Carter may be able to help break the political deadlock when he visits beginning July 6.

  - "Jennifer McCoy, of the Atlanta-based Carter Center," - not "Jennifer McCoy from the ...". So it is possible to say "John Brown of IBM".

  - "Atlanta-based" - another way of saying "based in Atlanta".

  - "told reporters Saturday" - not "on Saturday". "On" can be skipped sometimes. "I met her Friday" would probably work as well as "I met her on Friday".

  - "told that Carter may be able" - not _"might"_ - lack of reported (indirect) speech.

  - "when he visits" — not "when he will visit", even though it will be in the future.
